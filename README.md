# Gocker - A Gordon Docker repository

A Docker file repository with all the build files that I use in my Docker containers.

## The Torch setup

The Torch setup contains all the Docker files that I use in my Torch deep learning projects. It consists of Docker images based on Nvidia's [Docker project](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).

## The R setup

These are R Docker files that I use for testing my packages in new environments. They are built upon the [rocker-org](https://github.com/rocker-org) containers and are a practical approach to satisfying the requirements for [CRAN submissions](https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html).
